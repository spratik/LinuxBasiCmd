ls | tee a.txt /// tee cmd will print list of file and will print also in terminal

cat 1.txt 2.txt /// append 2.txt data to 1.txt data
cat -v unicode.txt /// nonprintable charactor -->use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB
cat -e 1.txt ///  display $ at end of each line
cat -t 1.txt /// display TAB characters as ^I
cat -n sample.file /// show number of line


-->head -2 file1 file2 // print specified line in output buffer 
o/p ::
==> file1 <==
pratik
solanki
==> file2 <==
akash
Hirakki

---> tail -2 file /// tail cmd print last secified line opposite to the head

--> combine head and tail
file1 contain following data
cat -n file
	 1	pratik
     2	solanki12345
     3	789456
     4	777

----> cut ==> cut command is useful for cut particular colum in file or list of file
ex --> ls -l | cut -c1,1-9, 50-60 //  it will cut only 1 - 9 cloum from list of file

fileName : field
contain :: // each word separate by tab  
pratik	solanki	harish
akash	123	456
pratik	789	101112



cut -f1 field // if delimeter is not specified then by default it will take tab 
			  // here -f stand for field and 1 stand for first colum
			  // so one tab take as one colum
o/p :
pratik
akash
pratik

cut -f1,2 field /// two colum show

pratik	solanki
akash	123
pratik	789


fileName :: field1
conatain ::
pratik/solanki/harish
akash/hirraki/123
gangu/56/89


cut -f3 -d"/" field1 /// here f3 meas third colum and delimeter is /
harish
123
89


NOTE :: the cut command is similar to the head and tail. 
the cut cmd cut files from verticale(colum vise) where head and tail cmd cut from horizontal



nice & renice ::
->both are useful for schdule the process. range is between -20 to 19. 
->if you schedule the process then that process use more CPU usage then other process
->run a program with modified scheduling priority

sudo nice --20 ./a.out & (& run in background)

change nice value 

sudo renice -10 ./a.out & --> change schedule from -20 to -10

ps -al //using this cmd we can see priority and nice value
